/**
 * This class implements a local thresholding algorithm, which while slower than the
 * GlobalHistogramBinarizer, is fairly efficient for what it does. It is designed for
 * high frequency images of barcodes with black data on white backgrounds. For this application,
 * it does a much better job than a global blackpoint with severe shadows and gradients.
 * However it tends to produce artifacts on lower frequency images and is therefore not
 * a good general purpose binarizer for uses outside ZXing.
 *
 * This class extends GlobalHistogramBinarizer, using the older histogram approach for 1D readers,
 * and the newer local approach for 2D readers. 1D decoding using a per-row histogram is already
 * inherently local, and only fails for horizontal gradients. We can revisit that problem later,
 * but for now it was not a win to use local blocks for 1D.
 *
 * This Binarizer is the default for the unit tests and the recommended class for library users.
